# 📈 Stock Price Predictor

A machine learning project aimed at predicting stock prices using historical data. This project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate the process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can forecast stock prices based on historical data. The project encompasses:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation of model performance

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saksham-89/Stock-Price-Predictor.git
   cd Stock-Price-Predictor
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Unix or MacOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Open `stock_predictor.ipynb` to explore the project.

## 📊 Usage

The Jupyter Notebook `stock_predictor.ipynb` guides you through:

- Loading and preprocessing stock data
- Visualizing data trends
- Building and training a predictive model
- Evaluating model performance

Follow the notebook cells sequentially to understand and replicate the workflow.
